No innovations were put in this project, I merely used the cog modules provided from discord.py 

Although I did learn the absolute basic of data management.

The only mentionable is the "Quote" feature, which removes the hassle to manually screenshot certian speeches and repasting them to mock someone or something else.
But the generated images were inaccurate due to the different image renderer.
Pilow was chosen because I have no idea how to generate images using html engines.
